## Connected Yorkshire data sources

This chapter describes the process by which data is pseudonymised and transferred from the source organisation to Connected Yorkshire.

We also provide a catalogue of data sources and data content and quality profiles from each.

Data that fits well with the OMOP Common Data Model is then transformed into OMOP. Some source data do not fit well with OMOP, however. This is especially true of data from non-clinical sources. In these cases the data is transformed to the Flexible Data Model.
