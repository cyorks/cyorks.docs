title: 4 The Flexible Data Model
---


## Getting started with the FDM

For the data that doesn't fit well with OMOP, we have adopted a Flexible Data Model. It is `flexible` in the sense that, while we have taken steps to standardise the data model as far as possible and to harmonise it with OMOP so it can easily be linked with OMOP data, we need to allow the data structure to vary considerably between sources.

### [FDM common data fields](./4-1-fdm-common-fields/)

Some fields have been set as standard across FDM dataset to facilitate linking across the FDM and with OMOP data.

### [Querying the FDM](./4-2-querying-fdm/)

Working with the Connected Yorkshire Flexible Data Model, with code examples in `SQL` and `R`.
